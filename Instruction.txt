* Please use Matlab R2019b and later versions for the implementation

* The performance matrix should be pre-processed and inserted in the form of Matrix P2 (normalized) in the paper (One column for each decision-maker)

* The matrix can be inserted from an excel file or directly in the Matlab file

* You may use any form of normalization based on your preferences 

* The code allows you to select one of the proposed framework versions based on the specific application, EABM, MABM, and SABM.
